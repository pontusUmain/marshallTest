# Description

Code assignment for Mashall, crypto currency app. Time spent, approx 16 hours

## Tools used
Async/Await for API calls (Honorable mention to Combine included)
UserDefaults
SwiftUI

## Sources used: 
- Crypto currencies: https://api.wazirx.com/sapi/v1/tickers/24hr
- Exchange rates: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/usd.json
- Names of crypto currencies: https://github.com/crypti/cryptocurrencies/blob/master/cryptocurrencies.json, downloaded as JSON and saved in Bundle

## What's next
Next steps if I would spend more time developing this app would include:
- Update user default favorites on app start to match new incoming prices
- Include timed updates to refetch prices on a regular basis
- Rewriting the network service as a protocol to introduce mock service and Unit Tests
